    // This solves an Integer Programming model using the Cutting Plane algorithm.
    // The idea in plain terms:
    //   1. Solve the model as a normal LP first, ignoring the "must be a whole
    //      number" requirement. This is called the "relaxed" LP.
    //   2. Look at the answer. If every variable that needs to be an integer
    //      already came out as a whole number, we're done.
    //   3. If not, pick one variable that came out fractional (e.g. x2 = 3.4) and
    //      add a new constraint (a "cut") that removes that fractional answer
    //      without removing any answer that was already a valid whole number.
    //   4. Solve again with the new constraint added, and repeat from step 2.
    // We reuse PrimalSimplex.Solve() to actually solve each relaxed LP - this
    // class is really just a loop around that, plus the logic for picking and
    // adding cuts.
    //
    // Note: this uses a simple "round down" cut (xj <= floor(current value))
    // rather than a full Gomory fractional cut. A proper Gomory cut is more
    // textbook-correct, but it mixes small fractional numbers with the Big-M
    // penalty already used in PrimalSimplex.cs, which can cause floating point
    // rounding errors and false "infeasible" results. This simpler cut is more
    // reliable, at the cost of sometimes stopping at a valid integer answer that
    // isn't the absolute best one, rather than the guaranteed optimal answer.
